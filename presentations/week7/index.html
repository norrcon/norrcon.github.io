    <h1> Explanation </h1>
    <p>-the large main 'Book Now' button at the top of the page</p>
    <p>  -the slogan 'Affordable.  Inclusive. Smart.' stands out being white and leads the readers eyes to the book now button</p>
      <p>-the nav bar is very minimalist with only 3 options.  One brings you back to homepage, one brings you to booking a flight now, and the book later tab brings you to a list of flights to view</p>
    <p>  -All 3 packages immediately have a Book Flight button underneath them which will help the reader immediately book a flight</p>
    <p>-Getting our site visitors to follow us on twitter will help ensure that no tickets go to waste.  Ideally we can use twitter to sell last minute flights for even cheaper than initally.</p>
